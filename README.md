These are some option pricing methods
The main assumptions are explained in the comments inside the code
For the Binomial option model I've used the original Cox, Ross e Rubinstein formulation of the 1979 paper "Option Pricing: A Simplified Approach" and I've built 2 versions: the first one is definitely slower but more intuitive, while the second one is much more efficient but it needs some numpy vectorisation tools in order to work
